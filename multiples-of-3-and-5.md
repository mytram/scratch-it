# Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Write a program to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## The modulo `mod` operator

In programming, the modulo operation gives the remainder of a division. In Scratch, look for the `mod` operator. For example `10 mod 3` is 1, and `10 mod 5` is 0. So we can tell that 9 is divisble by 3 because `9 mod 3` is `0`, in other words 9 is a multiple of 3.
