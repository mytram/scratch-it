# Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Write a program to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

  <summary>The modulo `mod` operator</summary>

In programming, the modulo operation gives the remainder of a division. In Scratch, look for the `mod` operator. For example `10 mod 3` is 1, and `10 mod 5` is 0. So we can tell that 9 is divisble by 3 because `9 mod 3` is `0`, in other words 9 is a multiple of 3.

  <summary>Variables</summary>
You will need two variables in this challenge. 
  
- One is to keep the result
- The other is to keep moving the number forward, from 1 to 999

  <summary>Algorithms</summary>
  
Here is a brute force algorithm. 
 
1. Start from number 0, and set the result to 0
1. increase the number by 1
1. If it meets the condition, add it to the result
1. repeat from step 2 if the number is below 1000
